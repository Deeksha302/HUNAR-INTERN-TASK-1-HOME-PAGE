            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, my name is Deeksha. I recently graduated in 2023 with a B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering. I'm currently interning in web development at Hunar, where I'm gaining practical experience in building and maintaining web applications.
                Previously, I completed internships at OASIS INFOBYTES, Prodigy Infotech, and CodSoft, where I worked on various projects such as creating a portfolio website, a temperature converter website, a stopwatch application, a to-do list project, and a GUI calculator. 
                I also completed a project-based internship at NIELIT Haridwar, where I worked on a water quality prediction project using Python and machine learning. During this internship, I also conducted webinars, organized technical competitions, and assisted students with their study-related queries.   
                I'm passionate about coding and continuously learning new technologies to improve my skills. In my free time, I enjoy working on personal projects and exploring new tools and frameworks in web development.</p>
